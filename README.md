# 🐄 𝛍 Project 🐄

I've always found it unintuitive to learn audio development. Many sources do not try to advertise the most practical journey, leaning towards absurdly dry and conceptualized texts.

Among the best resources I've seen is the [mu-project](https://mu.krj.st/), which seems to be a series of academic lectures with trivial implementations in C++.

I strive to get the essence of this lectures, structuring my own course in such a way, that would bring joy of exploration to an audio development field, that seem to lack it so much.

This repository does not yet provide any of my notes, proposing my variations of examples from mu project instead.
